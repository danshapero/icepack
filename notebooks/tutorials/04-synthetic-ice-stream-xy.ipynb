    "In this demo, we'll simulate the evolution of an ice stream with both grounded and floating parts.\n",
    "This scenario is a good bit more complex than the floating ice shelf we simulated in the previous demo.\n",
    "First, there are more fields.\n",
    "For floating ice shelves, we only had to consider the velocity, thickness, and fluidity.\n",
    "For grounded glaciers, we also have to include the surface elevation and bed friction.\n",
    "The diagnostic equation for an ice stream is similar to that of a floating ice shelf, but for the addition of a term for basal friction:\n",

    "$$\\nabla\\cdot hM - C|u|^{1/m - 1}u - \\rho gh\\nabla s = 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the *sliding exponent* and $C$ is the *sliding coefficient*.\n",
    "Second, the position of the grounding line -- the contour across which the glacier is thin enough to go afloat -- can migrate in time.\n",
    "Accurately predicting grounding line migration is a [major problem](https://doi.org/10.1029/2004JF000202) in glacier flow modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a test case, we'll use a geometry and input data from the third phase of the *Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project*, or MISMIP+.\n",
    "If you're not already familiar with the term, model intercomparison projects are standardized computational experiments that researchers design in order to test the degree to which different software packages produce outputs that do or don't agree with each other.\n",
    "There have been several ice sheet model intercomparison projects in the past, but they're common in other disciplines as well.\n",
    "For example, there have also been atmospheric model and paleoclimate model intercomparison projects.\n",
    "MISMIP+ has become a standard test case for evaluating glacier flow models and we'll revisit it again several times in the guides that follow.\n",

    "This sliding law assumes that the glaciers slide over hard beds by the process of [regelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regelation).\n",
    "Where the glacier flows over deformable sediments, the sliding relation could instead approach plasticity -- the stress depends only on the direction and not the magnitude of the velocity.\n",
    "Other sliding laws have been proposed that exhibit this feature, for example the law proposed in Schoof (2005), The effect of cavitation on glacier sliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In icepack, all of the diagnostic model physics is prescribed through an action principle.\n",
    "Rather than specify how the shear stress depends on the ice velocity, we specify the frictional energy dissipation.\n",
    "The stress is then the functional derivative of the dissipation with respect to velocity.\n",

    "### The Schoof sliding law\n",
    "\n",

    "\"Small\" and \"large\" will be defined relative to some threshold or critical speed $u_c$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The extra factor of $-u_c$ is there to make it so that $E(0) = 0$, i.e. there is no dissipation when there is no flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're going to use this more complex friction law, we also have to decide what values to use for the critical stress $\\tau_c$ and velocity $u_c$.\n",
    "The MISMIP+ experiment suggests taking the critical stress to be equal to half the pressure exerted by the ice above flotation.\n",
    "Just like we did before with the Weertman sliding law, this choice will give us the right ramping factor as we get towards the grounding line.\n",
