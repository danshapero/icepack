    "In this demo we'll look at Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland.\n",
    "Helheim is one of the bigger glaciers draining the Greenland Ice Sheet by mass flux along with Jakobshavn, Kangerdlugssuaq, Petermann, and the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream.\n",
    "Much of the procedure for working with real data should be familiar from the demo on [inverse problems](https://icepack.github.io/icepack.demo.04-ice-shelf-inverse.html), where we inferred the fluidity of the Larsen C Ice Shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula.\n",
    "Here we'll use many of the same techniques, only instead of inferring the fluidity, we'll look at the friction coefficient for glacier sliding over the underlying bedrock.\n",
    "In the following, we'll assume that ice flow is by Weertman sliding:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_b = -C|u|^{\\frac{1}{m} - 1}u,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_b$ is the basal shear stress, $u$ is the sliding velocity, $m \\approx 3$ is the friction exponent, and $C$ is the friction coefficient.\n",
    "First, we'll estimate the friction coefficient using a 2D, depth-averaged model.\n",
    "Then we'll use this solution as an initial guess using the 3D hybrid model that we showed in [this demo](https://icepack.github.io/icepack.demo.05-hybrid-ice-stream.html) for a synthetic ice stream."
